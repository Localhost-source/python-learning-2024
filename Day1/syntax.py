# Syntaxes are the grammar of a programming language
# We cannot mess up these syntaxes

# A important syntax rule in python is indentation for a code block

# In C language
a = 2
b = 3
# if(a == b){
# printf("a and b are equal")
# }

if a == b:
    print("a and b are equal")

# if a == b:
# print("a and b are equal")
