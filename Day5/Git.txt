# Git is a version control system

# Why do we need git?
=> It is used for version controlling
=> It is used in team collaboration

# Where do we store our code?
=> In github / gitlab / bitbucket
=> Github / gitlab / bitbucket understands the git language
=> Github and gitlab are the cloud based software solution (web-application) running in the web, which understands
the git terminologies and makes team collaboration easier.

Q. Why not google drive? onedrive?
=> Google drive / onedrive doen't understand the git language (commits, branches,
staging area and so on)
=> Team collaboration is also not so helpful in cloud based drives.
