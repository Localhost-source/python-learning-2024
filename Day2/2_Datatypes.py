# PY datatypes are:-
# Primitive 
# => Number (Int, float, complex)
# => String
# => Boolean
# => None
 
# Non-Primitive (List, Tuple, Dictionary, Set)

# Like in any other langauge python also has a set of datatypes
# Datatypes are the category of a data in programming language

# Python data types
# 1. Primitive Datatypes
        # => Number (Int, float, complex)
        # => String
        # => Boolean
        # => None
# 2. Non-primitive Types
    # => List
    # Tuple
    # Dictionary
    # Set


# Concept of Mutable and Immutable
# If a data is created an it can never be changed or altered then such data are immutable
# In contrast, mutable data are those which can be changed even after their creation

# Mutable Datatypes => List, Dictionary, Set
# Immutable Datatypes => Number, String, Boolean, Tuple


a = 1
print(a)  # 1
a = 2
print(a)  # 2
# Here initially a takes 1 as value and it is later changed to 2. But, these change is not done at the same
# memory location. So, int / number is an immutable datatype
